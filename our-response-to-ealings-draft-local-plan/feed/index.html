					<description><![CDATA[I do not see eye to eye with the Green Party on everything but on this it has my complete support. It appears that Ealing Council under Ealing Labour have complete and utter contempt for the environment, green space and democracy itself. Time and time again, they have over ridden public opinion to allow inappropriate development after inappropriate development and their addiction for building skyscrapers on every historic low rise residential street corner knows no bounds and no scruple. Ancient woodland will not stand in their way. Nor will historic manor houses. Pubic opinion? The mere buzzing of a mosquito in the ear of someone like Peter Mason. Democracy? A mere inconvenience to a fanatic socialist. Ealing is absolutely full to the brim with people. We don&#039;t need any more. The UK needs housing, yes, but it&#039;s not a matter for local councils. It&#039;s a matter for government and the mayoralty who are the only organisations that can form a holistic joined up strategy that considers the suitability of all sites across all of London and build only on the most suitable.

[&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REPLY from Ealing Friends of the Earth:&lt;/strong&gt; Thank you for your comment, but please note that we are &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; the Green Party. Friends of the Earth is a national charity and is not affiliated with any political party. We press for good environmental policies from local and national government, whatever party happens to be in power.&lt;/em&gt;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am appalled at the proposal of the removal of MOL on areas of Ealing. It contravenes the 2022-2027 biodiversity action plan outlined by Ealing Council.

					<description><![CDATA[I am absolutely horrified at the council’s compleat disinclination to protect our green belt, parks and open spaces.
Instead they wish to take away any protection they have previously had.
Why? What is in the heads of the Councillors making these utterly hideous proposals.
We love our green spaces, they have been completely protected until now.  WE ABSOLUTELY DISAGREE WITH ANY PROPOSALS TO IN ANY WAY DENUDE OUR PRECIOUS GREEN SPACES in order to allow more greedy developers to get their hands on our dearly loved open spaces.
The reason why Ealing is held in such high esteem is the nature we enjoy in our Borough.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The response is a sensible one and recognises that the Council&#039;s intention to increase the Borough&#039;s residential population by 50,000 over the next 10 years will present problems. How those problems will be met and resolved will be down to the Council. Existing residents will have to make up their minds whether they believe our Councillors have the necessary skills to implement such changes and safeguard our homes and quality of life.]]></description>

I do agree with everything written about over development of Acton. I live close to Gypsy Corner and don’t approve of Barratts proposal for 300 flats on such small land. Please forward this to Ealing Council]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am horrified by the loss of green spaces and proliferation of tower blocks that  that the Ealing  Council Plan proposes.  It will destroy the character of Ealing as a pleasant suburb to live in.   I do  not want to live in a poor imitation of  Manhattan. 
One of the joys of living in Ealing has been  the many views from its open spaces that end at tree height and sky. The  intrusion  of  characterless tower blocks will end that.   Also, when fully inhabited, these blocks will only bring more traffic and congestion into surrounding areas and will inevitably increase air pollution.

 Ealing Council is already not very good at maintaining its  services to residents, such as, for example, its pavement maintenance in many areas    It is difficult to believe it will cope any better with the  greatly increased density of population that  its plan  will bring.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I entirely agree with the above response to the consultation. The overwhelming invasion of &quot;high rises&quot; in recent years changes the &quot;feel&quot; and character of Acton as a community and, like almost everybody I know locally, makes us feel we are being swamped by the intruduction of masses of new people, cooped up in small  so called &quot;luxury&quot; appartments while local amenities and community services are not sufficiently increased.   Many of the existing and original housing stock is poorly insulated and not energy efficient. A lot more should be done about that.  Also local community and open spaces should be more protected and developpers should not be allowed to to encroach on those such as the W3 Friary green or the W3 St Dunstable triangles.  Another issue is the changing of the historic sky line (e.g. when walking down Churchfield Road) the recent appearance of large tower blocks  towering over old Acton buildings creates a claustrophobic feeling of historic Acton being swallowed up by developpers and developments with more traffic and further parking restrictions and less community amenities.  Very depressing, it destroys communities and makes one question whether to sell up and go.]]></description>
