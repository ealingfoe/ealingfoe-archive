Perivale Wood honey is much sought after at the annual Open Day, selling out within an hour of the start.<\/p><p>Last year the Selborne Society, which owns and maintains the wood, had a professional survey done of the \u2018aculeate hymenoptera\u2019 \u2013 bees and wasps to you and me. Our surveyor said he found lots of honeybees foraging on the wild flowers in Perivale Wood, but far fewer wild bees and wasps, both in terms of individuals and numbers of species, than he would expect from a site of this size and quality. He says this is due to the honeybees crowding out and out-competing the wild bees and wasps. The honeybees probably suppress other invertebrates as well \u2013 many other insects also use flowers. He recommends that we remove the hives from the reserve.<\/p><p>This all goes to show that ecology and conservation are rarely simple. It also illustrates the need for high-quality wildlife surveys. Otherwise we could act with the best intentions but harm our wildlife instead of helping it.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We are all being encouraged to \u2018be nice\u2019 to bees, and there has been a big increase in beekeeping in the past few years.
