I signed up for it to get some useful tips, though I thought I was doing as much as I could: I reuse or recycle whenever possible, avoid excessive packaging and compost organic waste.<\/p><p>I decided to keep an eye on what was going into the waste bin during the week and see if there was any way I could reduce what I was throwing away. Here\u2019s the list:<\/p><ol><li>Cat food pouches (metallised plastic film, non-recyclable).<\/li><li>Crisp packets (again metallised plastic film), plastic coated paper wrappers for biscuits.<\/li><li>Empty tea bags (contents put in compost). The brand I buy (Yorkshire Tea) uses plastic to seal the bags.<\/li><li>Other unrecyclable plastic, mainly thin film but some other packaging, sometimes marked \u201cnot currently recyclable\u201d.<\/li><li>Used tissues.<\/li><li>Antibacterial wipes (contain plastic)<\/li><li>Cigarette filters (cellulose acetate, which is a plastic)<\/li><\/ol>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-section elementor-top-section elementor-element elementor-element-3cdd1b3 elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default\" data-id=\"3cdd1b3\" data-element_type=\"section\" data-settings=\"{&quot;background_background&quot;:&quot;classic&quot;}\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-wider\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column elementor-element elementor-element-b5f240c\" data-id=\"b5f240c\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-d8590d1 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"d8590d1\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>All this resulted in a small carrier bag full during the week. So what can be done about this? In some cases there are simple solutions.<\/p><ol><li>Substitute tinned food. Before the advent of pouches this was the norm. Heavier to lug home and a bit of a pain to clean, but definitely recyclable. I remember my grandmother boiling up lights and other offal for her numerous cats, but this seems a step too far.<\/li><li>I wouldn\u2019t buy these for myself very often, but I\u2019m not the only person in the house. If you must have crisps it\u2019s better to buy sharing packs rather than multipack bags. Or try making your own snacks.<\/li><li>Most of the time I use loose leaf tea anyway. Yorkshire Tea say they have started to replace the plastic with renewable plant-based material. The new tea bags, though fully biodegradable, will need industrial rather than home composting.<\/li><li>Some plastic wrappers are marked \u201cRecycle with carrier bags at larger stores\u201d. Morrisons in Ealing, for instance, has well-marked containers encouraging people to leave bread wrappers etc. I am not sure, though, what to do with wrappers that say \u201cCheck local recycling\u201d, though as they are obviously recyclable they should be able to go in with bags.<\/li><li>I decided to let the worms have the germs and put tissues into my compost bin. If I hear sneezing I\u2019ll stop.<\/li><li>Just laziness really. There are alternatives: cloths with water, vinegar or lemon juice. What did we do before these wipes were invented?<\/li><li>I said I wasn\u2019t the only person in the house but until\/unless the smokers give up, the bin is probably the best place for fag ends. A study published in 2000 found that cigarette butts were toxic to aquatic life. As well as leaching chemicals into water, butts have been found in the stomachs of birds and animals who have mistaken them for food.<\/li><\/ol><p>Zero Waste Week is over for this year, but the fight against unnecessary waste goes on.
