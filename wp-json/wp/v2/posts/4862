They covered subjects as diverse as how to reduce London\u2019s emissions, air pollution, Heathrow airport, recycling, cycle lanes, electric cars and many more.<\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Onkar Sahota, who currently holds the seat, said that Labour had improved air quality in London by one third, would extend the Ultra Low Emission Zone to the north and south circular roads and make London zero carbon by 2030.<\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Gregory Stafford said polluting vehicles should be transformed including all London\u2019s buses made electric by the end of the term. He said there was a real opportunity to create about 11,000 green jobs and he would be pushing the Mayor to invest to grow the green job economy.<\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Anthony Goodwin said that people thought it was a good idea to introduce low traffic neighbourhoods and cycle lanes but it was important not to disregard the needs of other people.<\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Hussain Khan said the LibDems wanted a full rollout of zero emission buses by 2030, investment in green transport technology, money spent on innovation not on polluting new roadways like the Silvertown Tunnel under the River Thames in East London and cycle schemes encouraged.<\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Marijn van de Geer said that the climate emergency declared by the London Mayor Sadiq Khan had originally been proposed by Green Assembly member Caroline Russell. The Green Party wants all Greater London Authority investment to divest from fossil fuels, green jobs that would include retrofitting insulation, renewable energy and greening the boroughs and cycle paths that were connected up. She said electric cars \u2013 while better than petrol cars \u2013 were not the solution to the climate crisis and all decisions made should have a climate and environmental impact assessment.<\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">A question about Heathrow airport had been sent in by a campaigner who had been fighting its expansion for 28 years. She said that living in Harmondsworth she had been unable to bury her husband in the village due to the constant pressure of Heathrow destroying the community.<\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Four of the candidates agreed they were against the expansion of Heathrow but Anthony Goodwin said we had to look at the ramifications on people\u2019s lives.<\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The hustings concluded with a short statement from each of the candidates. Anthony Goodwin said that whole point of Reform UK was to change politics as they felt the two main parties had been mismanaging and misinterpreting what people wanted. Gregory Stafford said London needed someone to stand up to whoever becomes Mayor and that as a Conservative councillor in Ealing he had stood up against his own party on HS2 and Heathrow. Onkar Sahota said that he had gone into politics because as a doctor he cared about the NHS. But he attacked the Conservative mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey whom he accused of lying to Londoners. Marijn van de Geer said that we were now at the point where the climate crisis had to be taken seriously and that Greens put planet and people over profit and power. Hussain Khan concluded the hustings by saying that London had to play its part in tackling the global climate emergency and that he wanted to make London the leading green city.<\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Friends of the Earth local groups will be contacting the successful candidate at a later date to see how the Climate Pledge is being implemented.<\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">For a video of the hustings, please follow <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/VfdxLEgklF4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this link:<\/a>\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u00a0<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The climate crisis will be &#8216;top priority&#8217; for London whoever wins next week\u2019s London Assembly elections, say the candidates for the Ealing and Hillingdon seat.
