But when you consider the climate change benefits that a green front garden can provide, paving it over is the last thing you should do!<\/p><p>Paving a front garden causes at least ten major problems (see below). Each will be made worse by the effects of climate change. But each can be dramatically improved or completely eliminated by:<\/p><ol><li>keeping the front garden green \u2013 many plants are very low maintenance<\/li><li>\u201cdepaving\u201d: taking up most existing hard surfacing \u2013 you can do this little by little<\/li><li>for parking, use reinforced mesh just for where the wheels will be when the vehicle(s) are parked<\/li><li>the only hard surfacing being a path to the front door<\/li><\/ol><p>For guidance, have a look at the front gardens pages of the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) and the London National Park City websites and at \u201cdepaving\u201d projects in L B Lambeth and elsewhere.<\/p><p><strong>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>10 climate change problems and why green front gardens help:<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>Problem 1 \u2013 Increased flood risk:<\/strong> every square metre of hard surfacing increases the amount of rain run-off. Even porous surfaces and drainage channels can\u2019t cope with the increasingly torrential downpours that climate change is causing. This leads to flooding and outpourings of sewerage because the road drains can\u2019t cope \u2013 we\u2019ve already seen this in London.<\/p><p>A green garden with minimal hard surfacing (just the path) absorbs rainwater and allows it to percolate slowly through the soil, so there\u2019s no sudden influx of water into the road drains.<\/p><p><strong>Problem 2 \u2013 Over-heating:<\/strong> hard surfaces absorb heat in the daytime and release it at night, leading to hotter nights in built-up areas. This is the \u201cheat island effect\u201d. It makes town and cities unhealthily hot at night, especially as summers become hotter due to climate change. It also encourages people to install air conditioning \u2013 using yet more energy.<\/p><p>A green garden with minimal hard surfacing doesn\u2019t absorb nearly so much heat. Not only that, but the plants in the garden provide shade and cool the air by evapo-transpiration. Walk down any residential street in summer \u2013 it\u2019s like a frying pan where the front gardens are paved, but much cooler where there are trees and plants.<\/p><p><strong>Problem 3 \u2013 Less carbon dioxide absorption:<\/strong> plants in gardens and trees in streets take up CO<sub>2<\/sub> during the day for photosynthesis, but many paved front gardens have no plants at all. In addition, street trees and grass verges are sometimes removed to put in pavement crossovers (kerb drops) for parking.<\/p><p>A green front garden can have plants over nearly all its surface, even if used for parking. Add boundary hedges and climbers up walls. It all helps to add to the trees and plants we\u2019re relying on to counter climate change (by sequestering the CO<sub>2 <\/sub>created by burning fossil fuels).<\/p><p><strong>Problem 4 \u2013 Worse air pollution:<\/strong> paved front gardens next to roads don\u2019t absorb traffic-generated pollution and dust. This leads to higher levels of air pollution, especially from particulates which are known to damage to human health.<\/p><p>A green front garden will absorb roadside air pollutants, particularly if it has shrubs, hedges and trees. Research shows that many hedges trap air pollutants, so a front garden with a hedge reduces air pollution, forming a barrier to help to protect the occupants of the house.<\/p><p><strong>Problem 5 \u2013 Water pollution:<\/strong> climate change is increasing rain run-off. Run-off from paved front gardens picks up oil and heavy metals from the road surface plus pesticides, herbicides and other chemicals used in gardens and on pavements. This adds to the pollutant load and poorer water quality in local streams and rivers \u2013 in this borough the River Brent in particular.<\/p><p>A green garden with hedges, plants and minimal hard surfacing (just the path) absorbs rainwater and allows it to percolate slowly through the soil. This process helps remove pollutants from ground water as it flows slowly to rivers.<\/p><p><strong>Problem 6 \u2013 Loss of biodiversity:<\/strong> not only do paved front gardens have few or no plants and fewer street trees, the soil underneath becomes dry and sterile. The result is lack of habitat and support for all kinds of wildlife \u2013 soil dwellers, insects, birds and more \u2013 leading to measurable declines in their numbers.<\/p><p>A green front garden with functioning soil and plants supports all kinds of wildlife and adds to the \u201cgreen chain\u201d of support for the web of biodiversity.<\/p><p><strong>Problem 7 \u2013 Less food for pollinators:<\/strong> many paved front gardens have no flowering plants, so provide no nectar and pollen for pollinators. But nectar in urban areas is an important resource for pollinators (which we need to pollinate our food crops!) and gardens provide the vast majority of it, much more than parks and public spaces, verges, cemeteries etc.<\/p><p>A front garden planted with a judicious mix of flowering plants and shrubs can provide nectar and pollen from March till October. Even a few pots with flowers in every front garden can make a big difference.<\/p><p><strong>Problem 8 \u2013 Extensive environmental damage:<\/strong> the materials used for paving and concreting front gardens are dredged, quarried and processed. They are then transported over long distances \u2013 extremely long in the case of Chinese granite and the currently fashionable Indian sandstone. All this involves massive energy use and causes large-scale environmental damage.<\/p><p>A green front garden uses a much more limited range of materials. Furthermore, it is largely self-maintaining \u2013 there\u2019s no need for toxic weedkiller or cleaning products, and no need to replace or repair the surface every few years.<\/p><p><strong>Problem 9 \u2013 Subsidence:<\/strong> the soil under paved front gardens overheats and dries out. This can lead to movement of the ground and building foundations, especially in clay soils such as in London. It can be worsened by trees struggling to find water, so their roots grow further outwards and under buildings nearby.<\/p><p>A green garden with minimal hard surfacing (just the path) allows rainwater to sink in, maintaining normal soil structure and hydration for plants and trees.<\/p><p><strong>Problem 10 \u2013 Unattractive neighbourhoods:<\/strong> there\u2019s lots of evidence that lack of green space in towns and cities create stress, mental health and societal problems. Entire streets with paved front gardens and no hedges and street trees can look dirty, unattractive and threatening, and contact with neighbours is minimised.<\/p><p>Green front gardens create interest and stress-relieving green space. Plants, especially when in flower, have been shown to lift the spirits, and increase community cohesion by encouraging personal contact between neighbours.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-section elementor-top-section elementor-element elementor-element-7359f5c elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default\" data-id=\"7359f5c\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column elementor-col-50 elementor-top-column elementor-element elementor-element-35e98fe\" data-id=\"35e98fe\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-cd0b071 elementor-widget elementor-widget-image\" data-id=\"cd0b071\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"image.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure class=\"wp-caption\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/7ek6bOknbgc\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"490\" height=\"335\" src=\"https:\/\/ealingfoe.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Portland-Crescent-BEFORE.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-image-4421\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ealingfoe.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Portland-Crescent-BEFORE.jpg 490w, https:\/\/ealingfoe.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Portland-Crescent-BEFORE-300x205.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px\" \/>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figcaption class=\"widget-image-caption wp-caption-text\">Before<\/figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column elementor-col-50 elementor-top-column elementor-element elementor-element-dbbdc08\" data-id=\"dbbdc08\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-daaf96c elementor-widget elementor-widget-image\" data-id=\"daaf96c\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"image.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure class=\"wp-caption\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/7ek6bOknbgc\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" width=\"537\" height=\"344\" src=\"https:\/\/ealingfoe.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Portland-Crescent-AFTER.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-image-4422\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ealingfoe.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Portland-Crescent-AFTER.jpg 537w, https:\/\/ealingfoe.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Portland-Crescent-AFTER-300x192.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 537px) 100vw, 537px\" \/>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figcaption class=\"widget-image-caption wp-caption-text\">After.
