It can\u2019t. Climate change has happened for millions of years, before man made CO2 emissions, and will always change. We are better to adapt to warming, rather than pretend we can stop it.&#8221;<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>He is wrong. NASA and other scientists have shown that our planet&#8217;s average surface temperature has risen one degree Celsius since the late 19<sup>th<\/sup> century caused by increased carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere and other human activities. Most of this warming has happened in the past 40 years with the seven most recent years being the warmest.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>The earth&#8217;s climate has changed throughout history but the current warming is happening at a rate not seen in the past 10,000 years. Previous changes have been incredibly slow, taking place over millennia.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>The consequences of climate change include oceans getting warmer, glaciers retreating, snow cover decreasing, sea level rising and extreme events like high temperatures or low temperatures or increased rainfall happening more frequently.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>The whole balance of nature where bird and fish migrations happen so that they can feed on certain insects or plants when they are abundant is being destroyed; plants and trees come into leaf and flower using triggers provided by the air temperature. Eventually climate change will mean it will become more difficult to grow the food we need to survive.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>Steve Chilcott says: &#8221; Net Zero is the wrong focus and at the wrong price, in the wrong timeframe. Westminster\u2019s obsession with Net Zero is damaging our livelihoods and the economy. It has sent energy bills soaring, made it harder for businesses to compete and is costing tens of thousands of jobs and increasing inflation.&#8221;<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>But EFoE says that attempting to reach net zero is the only thing we can currently do to try to hold back climate change as there is no technological solution yet and won&#8217;t be for sometime, possibly ever. But doing nothing but trying &#8220;to adapt to warming&#8221; as Steve Chillcott says is defeatist and potentially dangerous as it will make the problem worse.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>The destruction of our planet and our way of life is not inevitable. We can try to limit the amount of CO2 we put into the atmosphere by making use of less polluting fuels \u2013 and this transition involves a whole new industry of green energy which will provide thousands of jobs. Admittedly some things could have been done better so all the more reason to make sure it&#8217;s done properly.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>Steve Chilcott is hoping to become the MP for Ealing Southall \u2013 an area with very close links to the Asian subcontinent where temperatures have been reaching an unprecedented 50 degrees Celsius. For the sake of his constituents and their wider families that is even more reason to campaign for reducing CO2 emissions to stop climate change.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>Steve Chilcott also says there are &#8220;some significant pollution issues in Ealing Southall, both in our waterways and also clean air issues around some of the brownfield developments.&#8221; He supports ensuring Warren Farm is fully protected as a wild and natural space \u2013 both points EFoE agrees with.<\/strong><\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-section elementor-top-section elementor-element elementor-element-256112c4 elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default\" data-id=\"256112c4\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-wider\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column elementor-element elementor-element-52612482\" data-id=\"52612482\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-3ae2ce2f elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"3ae2ce2f\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>At Reform we care about the environment and we want to use technology to do our bit. However, we believe Net Zero is the wrong focus and at the wrong price, in the wrong timeframe. Westminster\u2019s obsession with Net Zero is damaging our livelihoods and the economy. It has sent energy bills soaring, made it harder for businesses to compete and is costing tens of thousands of jobs and increasing inflation.<\/p><p>Net zero means reducing man made CO2 emissions to stop climate change. It can\u2019t. Climate change has happened for millions of years, before man made CO2 emissions, and will always change. We are better to adapt to warming, rather than pretend we can stop it. Up to 10 times more people die of cold than warmth. In Roman Britain some 2,000 years ago, it was 2 degrees warmer than now. Grapes for wine were grown in Yorkshire.<\/p><p>CO2 is essential for photosynthesis to enable plant growth. CO2 only represents 0.04% of the atmosphere; the average garden greenhouse has 3 times more! The UK produces only 1% of global CO2 emissions, yet China produces 27%. China and India are building hundreds of coal fired power stations. Even the IPCC admits Net Zero would make no difference to sea level rise for 200-1,000 years.<\/p><p>Instead, Net Zero sends our money abroad and damages critical industries like steel production. The current government has turned Britain from being an exporter of oil and gas into a net importer. They have bet our future on unreliable wind and solar power and destroyed our energy security. We need a common sense and practical energy strategy.<\/p><p>In terms of the local picture, we have some significant pollution issues in Ealing Southall, both in our waterways and also clean air issues around some of the brownfield developments such as the Green Quarter. I commit to seeking to address these issues, as a clean environment is essential for all of us who live in the constituency. I also commit to holding Labour Council to account in ensuring Warren Farm is fully protected as a wild and natural space.<\/p><p>Hope this helps.<\/p><p>Best regards<\/p><p>Steve Chilcott<\/p><p>Reform Parliamentary candidate for Ealing Southall<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-section elementor-top-section elementor-element elementor-element-1624ec5e elementor-section-full_width elementor-section-stretched elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default\" data-id=\"1624ec5e\" data-element_type=\"section\" data-settings=\"{&quot;background_background&quot;:&quot;classic&quot;,&quot;stretch_section&quot;:&quot;section-stretched&quot;}\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column elementor-element elementor-element-3c40108f\" data-id=\"3c40108f\" data-element_type=\"column\" data-settings=\"{&quot;background_background&quot;:&quot;classic&quot;}\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-6677a55d elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"6677a55d\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h1 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Liberal Democrats - EFoE assessment: 4\u00bd out of 5<\/h1>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-section elementor-top-section elementor-element elementor-element-7498e30a elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default\" data-id=\"7498e30a\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-wider\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column elementor-element elementor-element-43181523\" data-id=\"43181523\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-39a0d145 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"39a0d145\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>The Libdems are very busy.

A lot of the issues you\u2019re talking about resonate with me even in a personal level. The apartments that I live in (St Bernards, near Ealing Hospital) have very old windows that cannot be changed due to some sort of regulation which stands to preserve the history of the building. These windows however do not seal properly and make the apartments extremely cold and lead residents to use heating unnecessarily, I have been battling this with the relevant authorities but I can\u2019t imagine how many properties in Ealing suffer from the same thing.\u00a0<\/p><p>This is not only a waste financially for residents but also has a detrimental impact on the environment as an absolute waste of energy. As a young person I am dedicated to preserving our environment as much as possible as this planet is our future and I have seen many politicians and corporations use and abuse it for personal gain.
