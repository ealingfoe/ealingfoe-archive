Hi Christine. I agree, sharing stories and information about this subject would help. It&#039;s so easy to think that we can&#039;t change things as individuals, but we have more power than we think we do. If you find some ethical banks, please feel free to share them here.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I do not see eye to eye with the Green Party on everything but on this it has my complete support. It appears that Ealing Council under Ealing Labour have complete and utter contempt for the environment, green space and democracy itself. Time and time again, they have over ridden public opinion to allow inappropriate development after inappropriate development and their addiction for building skyscrapers on every historic low rise residential street corner knows no bounds and no scruple. Ancient woodland will not stand in their way. Nor will historic manor houses. Pubic opinion? The mere buzzing of a mosquito in the ear of someone like Peter Mason. Democracy? A mere inconvenience to a fanatic socialist. Ealing is absolutely full to the brim with people. We don&#039;t need any more. The UK needs housing, yes, but it&#039;s not a matter for local councils. It&#039;s a matter for government and the mayoralty who are the only organisations that can form a holistic joined up strategy that considers the suitability of all sites across all of London and build only on the most suitable.

[&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REPLY from Ealing Friends of the Earth:&lt;/strong&gt; Thank you for your comment, but please note that we are &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; the Green Party.

					<description><![CDATA[I am appalled at the proposal of the removal of MOL on areas of Ealing. It contravenes the 2022-2027 biodiversity action plan outlined by Ealing Council.

					<description><![CDATA[I am absolutely horrified at the council’s compleat disinclination to protect our green belt, parks and open spaces.
Instead they wish to take away any protection they have previously had.
Why? What is in the heads of the Councillors making these utterly hideous proposals.
We love our green spaces, they have been completely protected until now.  WE ABSOLUTELY DISAGREE WITH ANY PROPOSALS TO IN ANY WAY DENUDE OUR PRECIOUS GREEN SPACES in order to allow more greedy developers to get their hands on our dearly loved open spaces.
The reason why Ealing is held in such high esteem is the nature we enjoy in our Borough.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The response is a sensible one and recognises that the Council&#039;s intention to increase the Borough&#039;s residential population by 50,000 over the next 10 years will present problems. How those problems will be met and resolved will be down to the Council. Existing residents will have to make up their minds whether they believe our Councillors have the necessary skills to implement such changes and safeguard our homes and quality of life.]]></description>
